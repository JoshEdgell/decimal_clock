              <em>What's a decmial clock?</em>  A clock that has only 10 hours in a day, each comprised of a hundred 100-second minutes.
            </p>

            <p>
              <em>But that's 100,000 seconds - there are only 86,400 seconds in a day!</em>  Seconds are shorter in "decimal time" - about 15% shorter
            </p>

            <p>
              <em>OK...so why's there an app for it?</em>  Because I felt like making an app to demonstrate the concept of a decimal clock.
            </p>

            <p>
              <em>Couldn't you just make an app that displayed decimal time?</em>  I could have.  But there'd be no way for someone to see how quickly seconds tick by in a different time unit when compared to our own.
            </p>

            <p>
              <em>OK...so why didn't you just show decimal time against our own?</em>  Again, I could have.  But where's the fun in that?  I mean, haven't you ever wondered what a day would look like if there were 3 divisions that lasted 7 hours each and each of the 94 minutes was 57 seconds long?  OK, That's a bit much.  In short, though, I just thought the math would be cool, and the challenge of coding it out would be fun.
            </p>

            <p>
              <em>So why'd you include a stopwatches and a timers?</em>  Just felt like it, I guess.  Again, I figured the math would be kind of interesting, and that I might learn a few new CSS tricks in displaying them as a rotating cube.
